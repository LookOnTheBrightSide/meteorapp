“Next, create five root directories inside /microscope: /client, /server, /public, /lib, and /collections, and we'll also create empty main.html and main.js files inside /client. Don't worry if this breaks the app for now, we'll start filling in these files in the next chapter.

We should mention that some of these directories are special. When it comes to files, Meteor has a few rules:

Code in the /server directory only runs on the server.
Code in the /client directory only runs on the client.
